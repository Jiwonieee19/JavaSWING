TICTACTOE GAME (LOTS OF IF-ELSE BUT ILL TRY TO LESSEN THEM NEXT GAME)

THERE'S A LOT OF ROOM FOR IMPROVEMENTS LIKE HAVING AN ANIMATION USING GIF, AND CLEANING THE CODES
BUT I DID JUST CREATE THIS TO PRACTICE, SO ILL MOVE ON TO OTHER GAME CONCEPT

ILL TRY TO WRITE BETTER THAN THIS ONE NEXT TIME IN TERMS OF BUILDING LOGICS
